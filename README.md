# Synchronization application

Created purely for my private use. It was created after I bought external SSD and needed something that would sync files from my computer to SSD as a backup. Didin't want to use third-party software for privacy and saw opportunity to create something on my own.

Don't expect something groundbreaking but it has everything I need:
- It's fast
- It's
